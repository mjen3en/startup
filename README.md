[My Notes](notes.md)

This game creates a procedurly generated maze for two players to explore. The players race to get to the goal, while having their locations updated in real time through Websocket.

You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

I want to make a game where two players race to solve a randomly generated maze in real time. Every new game creates a new procedurally generated maze. Two players can then connect to the game and have their position displayed in real time. The first player to reach the end wins.

### Design

The first screen contains two options, Login and Sign Up, allowing new players to create an account and exitsing players to login in. The second screen has two options, to either create a new game or joing a pre-existing one. The third screen is the game itself, containing a procedurallly generated maze and allowing the player to control their character by way of arrow keys.

    Player2->>Server: P2 movement
    Server -->>Player1: P2 movement
    Server -->>Player2: P1 movement
```

### Key features

- Maze generation, procedurally generates maze to explore
- Player Movement
- Start and End Points
- Win Condition
- Muliplayer: Websocket allows for multiplayer in real time.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Three HTML pages, one for login/sign up, one for create/joing game, and the game itself
- **CSS** - Use CSS to style application, different colors for players, create high contrast maze that is easy to see and navigate.
- **React** - USe React to create components reactive to user actions (elements of the maze)
- **Service** - Backend for storing and retrieving games, allowing players to join other games with room code
- **DB/Login** - Store user info in database, retrieves the outcomes of previous matches and displays them
- **WebSocket** - As player moves, their position is displayed in real time to other player
- **Apis** - Use external api to generate random mazes https://github.com/odinn1984/mgapi, use 100ms api to generate and manage room codes
